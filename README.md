**Contributer**:Shichao Gao **Advisor**:Prof.Xiaojian Li,SIAT,CAS <br>
If there is any question,please feel free to contact:shichao_gao@outlook.com <br>
For some pioneering and significant work, my personal notes will be posted. <br>
Lastly,welcome browse my [personal website](https://www.edwingsc.com/) for more understandings of neural decoding.<br>
Any advice will be appreciatedÔºÅ
